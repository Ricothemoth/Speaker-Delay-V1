# Sound Source Distance Calculation

This project is a web-based tool for calculating trigonometric distance and time delay for different sound sources.

## Description

This web page allows users to input temperature, distances, and heights for high-frequency (HF), woofer, and sub sound sources. It then calculates the trigonometric distance and time delay in milliseconds for each source based on the entered values.

## Features

- Input fields for temperature, distances, and heights of sound sources.
- Calculation of trigonometric distance and time delay for each sound source.
- Option to include or exclude the listener's height in the calculation.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the required values for temperature, distances, and heights.
3. Click the "Calculate Distance" button.
4. View the results for each sound source.

## Dependencies

- None
